      A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—the part
      users see and interact with.<br />
      A front-end developer is a type of software developer who creates the user-facing side of
      websites and applications. They are well-versed in web development languages such as HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript that are designed for coding dynamic, interactive user experiences.
      Anytime you enjoy the look and feel of a digital product, website, or application, you have a
      front-end developer to thank.
